# TT-Gen
Time Table Assistant designed in Visual Studio

The problem was to design and implement an Time Table Assistant which will help the administrator to design time table by assigning time-slots and rooms to a given set of courses to be run that semester under  given  constraints.  The  constraints  include  avoiding  clashes  of  time-slots  and rooms, assigning appropriate rooms and appropriate no. of slots and contact hours to the courses etc 
Although most of the college administrative work has been computerized, the lecture timetable scheduling is still mostly done manually due to its technical difficulties. The manual  scheduling  of  lecture-timetable  requires  considerable  time  and  efforts.  The TT Gen helps reduce time and effort of the designer. 
We  have  formulated  the  method  for  developing  effective  and  practical  timetabling which is capable of taking care of both hard and soft constraints.  We were primarily  focused  on  developing  a semi automatic software,  which  was able implement  without compromising on its effectiveness and performance.
